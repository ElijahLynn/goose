# Scheduling Users And Tasks

When starting a load test, Goose assigns one `GooseTaskSet` to each `GooseUser` thread. By default, it assigns `GooseTaskSet`s (and then `GooseTask`s within the task set) in a round robin order. As new `GooseUser` threads are launched, the first will be assigned the first defined `GooseTaskSet`, the next will be assigned the next defined `GooseTaskSet`, and so on, looping through all available `GooseTaskSet`s. Weighting is respected during this process, so if one `GooseTaskSet` is weighted heavier than others, that `GooseTaskSet` will get assigned to `GooseUser`s more at the end of the launching process.

The `GooseScheduler` can be configured to instead launch `GooseTaskSet`s and `GooseTask`s in a `Serial` or a `Random order`. When configured to allocate in a `Serial` order, `GooseTaskSet`s and `GooseTask`s are launched in the extact order they are defined in the load test (see below for more detail on how this works). When configured to allocate in a `Random` order, running the same load test multiple times can lead to different amounts of load being generated.

Prior to Goose `0.10.6` `GooseTaskSet`s were allocated in a serial order. Prior to Goose `0.11.1` `GooseTask`s were allocated in a serial order. To restore the old behavior, you can use the `GooseAttack::set_scheduler()` method as follows:

```rust,ignore
    GooseAttack::initialize()?
        .set_scheduler(GooseScheduler::Serial);
```

To instead randomize the order that `GooseTaskSet`s and `GooseTask`s are allocated, you can instead configure as follows:

```rust,ignore
    GooseAttack::initialize()?
        .set_scheduler(GooseScheduler::Random);
```

The following configuration is possible but superfluous because it is the scheduling default, and is therefor how Goose behaves even if the `.set_scheduler()` method is not called at all:

```rust,ignore
    GooseAttack::initialize()?
        .set_scheduler(GooseScheduler::RoundRobin);
```

## Scheduling Example

The following simple example helps illustrate how the different schedulers work.

```rust,ignore
use goose::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), GooseError> {
    GooseAttack::initialize()?
        .register_taskset(taskset!("TaskSet1")
            .register_task(task!(task1).set_weight(2)?)
            .register_task(task!(task2))
            .set_weight(2)?
        )
        .register_taskset(taskset!("TaskSet2")
            .register_task(task!(task1))
            .register_task(task!(task2).set_weight(2)?)
        )
        .execute()
        .await?
        .print();

    Ok(())
}
```

## Round Robin Scheduler

This first example assumes the default of `.set_scheduler(GooseScheduler::RoundRobin)`.

If Goose is told to launch only two users, the first GooseUser will run `TaskSet1` and the second user will run `TaskSet2`. Even though `TaskSet1` has a weight of 2 `GooseUser`s are allocated round-robin so with only two users the second instance of `TaskSet1` is never launched.

The `GooseUser` running `TaskSet1` will then launch tasks repeatedly in the following order: `task1`, `task2`, `task1`. If it runs through twice, then it runs all of the following tasks in the following order: `task1`, `task2`, `task1`, `task1`, `task2`, `task1`.

## Serial Scheduler

This second example assumes the manual configuration of `.set_scheduler(GooseScheduler::Serial)`.

If Goose is told to launch only two users, then both `GooseUser`s will launch `TaskSet1` as it has a weight of 2. `TaskSet2` will not get assigned to either of the users.

Both `GooseUser`s running `TaskSet1` will then launch tasks repeatedly in the following order: `task1`, `task1`, `task2`. If it runs through twice, then it runs all of the following tasks in the following order: `task1`, `task1`, `task2`, `task1`, `task1`, `task2`.

## Random Scheduler

This third example assumes the manual configuration of `.set_scheduler(GooseScheduler::Random)`.

If Goose is told to launch only two users, the first will be randomly assigned either `TaskSet1` or `TaskSet2`. Regardless of which is assigned to the first user, the second will again be randomly assigned either `TaskSet1` or `TaskSet2`. If the load test is stopped and run again, there users are randomly re-assigned, there is no consistency between load test runs.

Each `GooseUser` will run tasks in a random order. The random order will be determined at start time and then will run repeatedly in this random order as long as the user runs.

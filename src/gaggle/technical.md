# Technical Details

Goose uses [`nng`](https://docs.rs/nng/) to send network messages between the Manager and all Workers. [Serde](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/index.html) and [Serde CBOR](https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor) are used to serialize messages into [Concise Binary Object Representation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049).

Workers initiate all network connections, and push metrics to the Manager process.

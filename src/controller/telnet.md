# Telnet Controller

The host and port that the telnet Controller listens on can be configured at start time with `--telnet-host` and `--telnet-port`. The telnet Controller can be completely disabled with the `--no-telnet` command line option. The defaults can be changed with `GooseDefault::TelnetHost`,`GooseDefault::TelnetPort`, and `GooseDefault::NoTelnet`.

To learn about all available commands, telnet into the Controller thread and enter `help` (or `?`), for example:
```bash
% telnet localhost 5116
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
